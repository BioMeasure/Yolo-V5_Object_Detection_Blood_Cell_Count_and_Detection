In this project, I've trained an object detection model on a custom dataset to find the number of RBC, WBC, PLATELETS Count from the microscopic blood-smeared images.

Simply start the training and validation here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bala-codes/Yolo-v5_Object-Detection_Blood_Cell_Count/blob/master/codes/BCC%20Training%20%26%20Testing%20-%20Yolo-v5.ipynb) and to begin inference  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bala-codes/Yolo-v5_Object-Detection_Blood_Cell_Count/blob/master/codes/BCC%20INFERENCE%20Yolo-v5.ipynb)

The Inference notebook is similar to move the model in production environment. You need to these files in your system path for proper imports, you can get them from here       [Yolo-v5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
